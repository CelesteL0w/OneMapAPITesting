# OneMapAPITesting
This is my first time using API. For my school project, I had to take the full address for a HDB flat in Singapore and generate the latitude and  longitude to plot a map in Tableau.

The datasets include Primary Schools in Singapore and housing resale prices of HDB flats in Singapore wrangled from Data.gov.sg as well as the API output file of lat, lon and postal codes. 
The tableau file shows the other findings I had throughout the project as well as how the map turned out in the end. 
The jupyter notebook file showcases my testing process (after much cleaning and effort) to get the output file. Credits to https://github.com/mylee16/onemap-api.
